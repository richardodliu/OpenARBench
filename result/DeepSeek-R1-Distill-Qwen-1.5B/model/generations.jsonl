{"task_id": 81, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the binary cross-entropy (BCE) cost between the predicted probabilities (A2) and the ground-truth binary labels (Y). The BCE cost is a common loss function used in binary classification problems and is defined as:\n\n\\[ J = -\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left[ y_i \\ln(a_i) + (1 - y_i) \\ln(1 - a_i) \\right] \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the number of samples, \\( a_i \\) is the predicted probability for the \\( i \\)-th sample, and \\( y_i \\) is the ground-truth label (0 or 1).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Clipping the Predicted Probabilities**: To avoid taking the logarithm of zero or one, which would result in undefined values, we clip the predicted probabilities \\( A2 \\) to the interval \\([ \\epsilon, 1 - \\epsilon ]\\), where \\( \\epsilon = 10^{-15} \\). This ensures that \\( a_i \\) is always within a valid range for the logarithm function.\n2. **Compute the Cost**: Calculate the BCE cost using the formula provided.

{"task_id": 224, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement a Leaky ReLU activation function that can handle both scalar values and nested lists or numpy arrays. The Leaky ReLU function is designed to allow gradient flow through the network when the input is negative, while setting the output to zero for positive inputs. The function should return a result with the same structure as the input, converted to a Python list.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Leaky ReLU Function**: The Leaky ReLU function is defined as:\n   - \\( \\text{LeakyReLU}(x) = x \\) if \\( x \\geq 0 \\)\n   - \\( \\text{LeakyReLU}(x) = a \\cdot x \\) if \\( x < 0 \\)\n   where \\( a \\) is a positive slope parameter (default 0.01).\n\n2. **Handle Different Input Types**: The input can be a scalar, a nested list, or a numpy array. The function must process each element recursively if it is a nested list or array.\n\n3. **Recursive Processing**: For each element in the input, if it is a list or numpy array, the function processes each element recursively. If it is a scalar, it applies the Leaky ReLU transformation directly.\n\n4. **Return Structure-Preserving Output**: The output must maintain the same structure as the input, whether it is a list, numpy array, or scalar.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef leaky_relu(z, a=0.01):\n    \"\"\"Apply the Leaky ReLU activation to every element in *z.\n\n    Args:\n        z: A scalar, list (possibly nested) or ``numpy.ndarray`` of numbers.\n        a: Optional float in [0,1) \u2014 the slope for negative inputs.

If it is, it processes each element recursively. If not, it applies the Leaky ReLU transformation.\n\n2. **Handling Different Input Types**: The function `process_array` converts a numpy array into a numpy array of the same structure, while `process_list` processes a list element-wise.\n\n3. **Structure Preservation**: The function ensures that the output maintains the same structure as the input by recursively processing each element and returning the transformed values in the appropriate structure (list or numpy array).\n\nThis approach ensures that the Leaky ReLU activation function is applied correctly to all elements, whether they are scalars, lists, or numpy arrays, while preserving the input's structure in the output."}
{"task_id": 261, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement the Glorot (also known as Xavier) normal initialization function for a given tensor shape. This initialization method helps in keeping the variance of the initialized layers stable, which is crucial for training deep neural networks.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to implement the Glorot normal initialization involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Determine Fan In and Fan Out**: \n   - For a 2D tensor shape `(fan_in, fan_out)`, the fan_in and fan_out are directly the dimensions of the tensor.\n   - For higher-dimensional tensors, such as those used in convolutional layers, the fan_in and fan_out are computed based on the kernel size. The kernel size is the product of all dimensions after the first two. Thus, fan_in and fan_out are calculated as the product of the number of channels (first two dimensions) and the kernel size.\n\n2. **Compute Standard Deviation**:\n   - The standard deviation `s` is calculated using the formula `sqrt(2 / (fan_in + fan_out))`.\n\n3. **Generate Initial Array**:\n   - Using NumPy, generate an array of the specified shape with values drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef glorot_normal(shape: tuple[int, ...]) -> np.ndarray:\n    in_channels = shape[0]\n    out_channels = shape[1]\n    kernel_size = 1\n    for dim in shape[2:]:\n        kernel_size *= dim\n    fan_in = in_channels * kernel_size\n    fan_out = out_channels * kernel_size\n    s = np.sqrt(2.0 / (fan_in + fan_out))\n    return np.random.normal(0.0, s, shape)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Fan In and Fan Out Calculation**: \n  - For a 2D tensor, the fan_in and fan_out are simply the dimensions of the tensor. For higher-dimensional tensors, the kernel size is computed as the product of all dimensions after the first two, and then multiplied by the number of channels to get the fan_in and fan_out.\n  \n- **Standard Deviation Calculation**: \n  - The standard deviation is derived from the formula `sqrt(2 / (fan_in + fan_out))`, which ensures that the variance is appropriately scaled to maintain stable gradients during training.\n\n- **Array Initialization**: \n  - Using NumPy's `random.normal` function, we generate an array filled with values from a normal distribution with the specified mean (0) and standard deviation (s). This array matches the exact requested shape and dtype.\n\nThis approach ensures that the initialized weights are initialized in a way that helps in maintaining the stability of the training process, especially in deep neural networks."}

Two trees are considered equivalent if they have the same structure, use the same features at each node, and have values that are within a specified tolerance of each other.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Base Case for Leaves**: If both trees are leaves, we compare their values using `numpy.allclose` to check if they are equivalent within a tolerance of 1e-8.\n2. **Different Tree Types**: If one tree is a leaf and the other is a node, they are not equivalent.\n3. **Base Case for Nodes**: If both trees are nodes, we check if their features are the same.

The Mel filterbank is a key component in speech and audio processing, used to convert frequency data into a form suitable for machine learning tasks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Frequency to Mel Scale**: The Mel scale is a perceptual scale that maps frequencies to a continuous scale. This conversion is necessary because the human ear perceives frequencies logarithmically.\n2. **Generate Mel Points**: These are equally spaced points on the Mel scale. The number of points is determined by the number of filters plus two.\n3. **Convert Mel Points to Filter Corners**: Each Mel point is converted to a frequency using the inverse Mel scale formula.\n4. **Define Filter Edges**: For each filter, the left and right edges are defined by consecutive Mel points.\n5. **Compute Filter Weights**: For each bin, the center frequency is computed, and the weight for that bin in each filter is determined based on the distance to the filter edges.

{"task_id": 343, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) to update the sampling distribution based on the best samples obtained from the current episode. The goal is to compute the mean and the per-dimension variance of the retained elite samples, which will be used to update the sampling distribution.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Best Samples**: The first step is to identify the best samples based on their total return. This involves finding the maximum reward value in the rewards array.\n2. **Select Top Samples**: Once the maximum reward is identified, we select the top `retain_prcnt` fraction of the samples that have this maximum reward. If `retain_prcnt * N` is not an integer, we use the floor of this product to determine the number of samples to retain.\n3. **Compute Mean and Variance**: For the selected elite samples, compute the mean and the per-dimension variance. Each dimension of the samples is processed separately to compute the mean and variance.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef cross_entropy_update(theta_samples: np.ndarray,\n                          rewards: list[float] | np.ndarray,\n                          retain_prcnt: float) -> tuple[list[float], list[float]]:\n    max_reward = np.max(rewards)\n    samples = list(zip(rewards, theta_samples))\n    sorted_samples = sorted(samples, key=lambda x: -x[0])\n    k = int(retain_prcnt * len(theta_samples))\n    selected_theta = [s[1] for s in sorted_samples[:k]]\n    \n    D = len(selected_theta[0])\n    means = []\n    for d in range(D):\n        d_values = [s[d] for s in selected_theta]\n        mean = np.mean(d_values)\n        means.append(mean)\n    \n    variances = []\n    for d in range(D):\n        mean_d = means[d]\n        squared_diff = [(x - mean_d)**2 for x in selected_theta[:k][d]]\n        var = np.mean(squared_diff)\n        variances.append(var)\n    \n    means_rounded = [round(m, 4) for m in means]\n    variances_rounded = [round(v, 4) for v in variances]\n    \n    return (means_rounded, variances_rounded)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Identify the Best Samples**: We first find the maximum reward value in the `rewards` array. This helps us identify the best samples.\n2. **Select Top Samples**: We create a list of tuples where each tuple contains a reward and the corresponding theta sample. This list is sorted in descending order based on the reward. We then select the top `k` samples, where `k` is the floor of `retain_prcnt * N`.\n3. **Compute Mean and Variance**: For each dimension, we extract the corresponding values from the selected elite samples. We compute the mean and variance for each dimension separately. The mean is the average of the values, and the variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently update the sampling distribution by retaining only the most promising samples, which is crucial for the Cross-Entropy Method in reinforcement learning."}
{"task_id": 353, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Shannon entropy of a one-dimensional sequence of class labels. Shannon entropy is a measure of impurity or disorder in a set of class labels, which helps in understanding the impurity of a set of labels. The formula for Shannon entropy is given by:\n\n\\[ H = -\\sum_i p_i \\log_2 p_i \\]\n\nwhere \\( p_i \\) is the probability of each class label \\( i \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Handle Empty Input**: If the input is an empty list, return 0.0 immediately.\n2. **Convert to List**: Convert the input to a list to handle cases where the input might be a NumPy array.\n3. **Count Occurrences**: Use a counter to determine the occurrences of each unique label.\n4. **Calculate Probabilities**: Compute the probability of each label by dividing its count by the total number of labels.\n5. **Compute Entropy**: For each probability, compute its contribution to the entropy using the formula and sum these contributions.\n6. **Round Result**: Round the computed entropy to 5 decimal places before returning.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef entropy(labels) -> float:\n    labels = list(labels)\n    if not labels:\n        return 0.0\n    counts = Counter(labels)\n    unique_labels = list(counts.keys())\n    total = len(labels)\n    probabilities = {label: count / total for label, count in counts.items()}\n    entropy_value = 0.0\n    for label, p in probabilities.items():\n        if p == 0:\n            continue\n        entropy_value += (-p * math.log2(p))\n    return round(entropy_value, 5)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Handling Empty Input**: The function first checks if the input list is empty and returns 0.0 if true.\n2. **Counting Occurrences**: Using `Counter` from the `collections` module, we count how many times each label appears in the input.\n3. **Calculating Probabilities**: Each label's probability is determined by dividing its count by the total number of labels.\n4. **Computing Entropy**: For each label, the contribution to the entropy is calculated using the formula \\(-p \\log_2 p\\). These contributions are summed up to get the total entropy.\n5. **Rounding**: The result is rounded to 5 decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the Shannon entropy while handling various edge cases, such as empty inputs and different data types."}
{"task_id": 356, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the prediction from a leaf node in a decision tree, whether the tree is for classification or regression. The leaf node's value can be either a list of class probabilities or a scalar value, depending on the type of tree.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check the Tree Type**: Determine if the tree is for classification or regression based on the ` classifier` parameter.\n2. **Classify Leaf Node**:\n   - If the tree is for classification, the leaf node's value is a list of probabilities. We need to find the index of the maximum probability. In case of ties, the smallest index is chosen.\n   - If the tree is for regression, the leaf node's value is a scalar, and we simply return this value.\n3. **Return the Result**: For classification, return the index of the maximum probability.

Using `np.argmax`, we find the index of the highest probability. In case of ties, the smallest index is chosen to ensure consistency.\n- **Regression Handling**: When the tree is not classified, the leaf node's value is a scalar, which is directly returned as the prediction.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles both cases using basic list operations and numpy functions, ensuring optimal performance."}

The function should handle both regression and classification tasks, returning different outputs based on the type of task.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with a running prediction initialized to zeros, with the same shape as the first update array.\n2. **Update Predictions**: For each tree update, subtract the scaled output of the tree from the running prediction. The scaling factor is the learning rate.\n3. **Regression Task**: After processing all updates, return the running prediction rounded to 4 decimal places.\n4. **Classification Task**: Convert the running prediction to logits, compute the probabilities using the softmax function, and then determine the predicted class indices by taking the argmax of the probabilities.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gradient_boosting_predict(updates: list[np.ndarray], learning_rate: float, regression: bool) -> np.ndarray:\n    running_pred = np.zeros_like(updates[0])\n    for u in updates:\n        running_pred -= learning_rate * u\n    if regression:\n        return running_pred.round(4).flatten()\n    else:\n        exps = np.exp(running_pred)\n        sum_exps = np.sum(exps, axis=1, keepdims=True)\n        probs = exps / sum_exps\n        return probs.argmax(axis=1).flatten()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The running prediction is initialized to zeros with the same shape as the first update array. This ensures that the shape is consistent for all subsequent operations.\n2. **Updating Predictions**: Each tree's prediction is scaled by the learning rate and subtracted from the running prediction. This step aggregates the contributions of all trees in a way that mimics gradient descent in boosting.\n3. **Regression Handling**: After processing all updates, the running prediction is rounded to 4 decimal places and returned. This is the final regression prediction.\n4. **Classification Handling**: The running prediction is converted to logits. Using the softmax function, these logits are converted to probabilities. The argmax function is then applied to determine the class with the highest probability, which is returned as the prediction.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function is efficient and handles both regression and classification tasks correctly, leveraging vectorized operations for optimal performance."}

The Gini impurity is a measure used in decision-tree learning to quantify how often a randomly chosen element from the set would be incorrectly labelled if it were randomly labelled according to the distribution of labels in the subset.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Empty Input**: If the input list is empty, return 0.0 immediately as there are no labels to compute the Gini impurity for.\n2. **Count Occurrences**: Use a counter to count the occurrences of each unique label in the input list.\n3. **Calculate Relative Frequencies**: For each unique label, compute the relative frequency by dividing the count of the label by the total number of elements.\n4. **Compute Squared Frequencies**: Square each relative frequency and sum these squared values.\n5. **Calculate Gini Impurity**: Subtract the sum of squared frequencies from 1 to get the Gini impurity.\n6. **Round the Result**: Return the result rounded to four decimal places.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef gini(y: list[int] | \"np.ndarray\") -> float:\n    if not y:\n        return 0.0\n    counts = Counter(y)\n    N = len(y)\n    total = 0.0\n    for c in counts:\n        p = counts[c] / N\n        total += p ** 2\n    gini_impurity = 1.0 - total\n    return round(gini_impurity, 4)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Empty Input Handling**: The function first checks if the input list is empty and returns 0.0 if it is.\n- **Counting Occurrences**: Using `Counter` from the `collections` module, we efficiently count how many times each label appears in the input list.\n- **Relative Frequencies and Squared Sums**: For each unique label, we compute its relative frequency and then square this frequency. The sum of these squared values is computed.\n- **Gini Impurity Calculation**: The Gini impurity is calculated as 1 minus the sum of the squared frequencies.\n- **Rounding**: The result is rounded to four decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and accurately compute the Gini impurity for any given label sequence, handling both list and numpy array inputs appropriately."}

A matrix is considered symmetric if it is square and equal to its own transpose. Due to potential floating-point precision issues, we will use a tolerance value to check for equality.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check if the Matrix is Square**: First, we verify if the input matrix is square. This is done by checking if the number of rows is equal to the number of columns.\n2. **Transpose the Matrix**: Compute the transpose of the matrix. The transpose of a matrix is obtained by swapping its rows with columns.\n3. **Compare Elements Using Tolerance**: Use NumPy's `allclose` function to compare each element of the original matrix with the corresponding element in its transpose. The comparison is done with a tolerance of \\(1 \\times 10^{-8}\\) to account for floating-point precision issues.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef is_symmetric(X: list[list[int | float]]) -> bool:\n    # Check if the matrix is square\n    if len(X) == 0 or len(X[0]) == 0:\n        return False\n    n = len(X)\n    if n != len(X[0]):\n        return False\n    \n    # Compute the transpose of the matrix\n    X_transpose = np.transpose(X)\n    \n    # Check if the matrix is symmetric using allclose with the given tolerance\n    return np.allclose(X, X_transpose, rtol=1e-8, atol=1e-8)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Square Check**: The function first checks if the matrix is empty or if the number of rows and columns are not equal, returning `False` if either condition is met.\n2. **Transpose Calculation**: The transpose of the matrix is computed using NumPy's `transpose` function, which efficiently swaps rows and columns.\n3. **Element Comparison**: The `allclose` function is used to compare each element of the original matrix with the corresponding element in its transpose.

{"task_id": 394, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement the RMSprop optimizer update step in Python. RMSprop is an adaptive learning-rate optimization algorithm that adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradient information.

In case of a tie, select the feature with the smallest index.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef choose_best_feature(X: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray) -> tuple[int, float]:\n    \"\"\"Return the feature index that yields maximal information gain.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    X : np.ndarray\n        2-D array of shape (n_samples, n_features) containing discrete feature\n        values encoded as non-negative integers starting from 0.\n    y : np.ndarray\n        1-D array of shape (n_samples,) containing integer class labels starting from 0.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    tuple[int, float]:\n        A tuple consisting of the index of the best feature and the maximum\n        information gain rounded to 6 decimal places.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Compute entropy of the target class y\n    y_counts = np.bincount(y)\n    total = len(y)\n    if total == 0:\n        H_y = 0.0\n    else:\n        p = y_counts / total\n        H_y = -np.sum(p * np.log2(p))\n    \n    gains = []\n    for feature in range(X.shape[1]):\n        unique_values = np.unique(X[:, feature])\n        H_y_given_A = 0.0\n        for a in unique_values:\n            mask = (X[:, feature] == a)\n            group_x = X[mask]\n            group_y = y[mask]\n            counts = np.bincount(group_y)\n            total_group = len(group_y)\n            if total_group == 0:\n                continue\n            p = counts / total_group\n            H_i = -np.sum(p * np.log2(p))\n            weight = (len(group_x)) / total\n            H_y_given_A += weight * H_i\n        gain = H_y - H_y_given_A\n        gains.append((gain, feature))\n    \n    # Find the feature with the maximum information gain\n    max_gain = -1.0\n    best_feature_index = 0\n    for i, (gain, feature) in enumerate(gains):\n        if gain > max_gain:\n            max_gain = gain\n            best_feature_index = feature\n        elif gain == max_gain:\n            if feature < best_feature_index:\n                best_feature_index = feature\n    \n    # Round to 6 decimal places\n    max_gain_rounded = round(max_gain, 6)\n    return (best_feature_index, max_gain_rounded)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Entropy Calculation**: The entropy of the target class is computed using the binomial coefficient to count occurrences of each class label. This entropy measures the impurity of the current class distribution.\n\n2. **Feature Splitting and Information Gain**: For each feature, the data is split into groups based on the feature's values. For each group, the entropy of the class distribution is computed. The weighted average of these group entropies is subtracted from the entropy of the target class to get the information gain for that feature.\n\n3. **Feature Selection**: The feature with the highest information gain is selected. In case of a tie, the feature with the smallest index is chosen. The result is returned as a tuple containing the best feature index and the maximum information gain, rounded to six decimal places.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the most informative feature for splitting the data in a decision tree, maximizing the model's ability to separate the data into distinct classes."}

The solution involves calculating these parameters from the feature matrix, label vector, and Lagrange multipliers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Compute the Weight Vector (w)**:\n   - The weight vector is computed as the dot product of the feature matrix transpose and the product of the Lagrange multipliers and the label vector. If the feature matrix has only one feature, the result is a scalar, which is then wrapped into a list.\n\n2. **Compute the Bias Term (b)**:\n   - The bias term is calculated using the formula derived from the SVM optimization problem. It is the average of the differences between the label values and the dot product of the weight vector and each feature vector.\n\n3. **Rounding**:\n   - Both the weight vector and bias term are rounded to four decimal places for the final result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_svm_parameters(X: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray, alpha: np.ndarray) -> tuple[list[float], float]:\n    n_samples, n_features = X.shape\n    if n_features == 1:\n        w = [X.T @ (alpha * y)[0]]\n    else:\n        w = X.T @ (alpha * y)\n    w_rounded = np.round(w, 4)\n    b = (1.0 / n_samples) * np.sum(y - w @ X.T)\n    b_rounded = np.round(b, 4)\n    return (w_rounded, b_rounded)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Weight Vector Calculation**:\n   - The weight vector `w` is computed using the formula `w = X^T @ (alpha * y)`. If the feature matrix `X` has only one feature, the result is a scalar, which is wrapped into a list to match the expected output format.\n\n2. **Bias Term Calculation**:\n   - The bias term `b` is calculated using the formula `b = (1/n) * sum(y - w^T x_i)`, where `x_i` is each feature vector. This formula ensures that the hyperplane is correctly positioned to maximize the margin.\n\n3. **Rounding**:\n   - Both `w` and `b` are rounded to four decimal places to ensure the results are precise and formatted correctly.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the SVM parameters using the given Lagrange multipliers, ensuring accuracy and correctness in the results."}

The network is fully-connected, meaning each neuron in a layer is connected to all neurons in the previous layer.\n\n2. **Intuition**: Each layer processes the input by computing the dot product with the layer's weights, adding the bias term, and applying ReLU except for the last layer, which uses a linear function.\n\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Initialize the current input as the given feature vector.\n   - Iterate through each layer of the network.\n   - For each layer, compute the pre-activation by taking the dot product of the current input and the layer's weights, then add the bias term.\n   - Apply ReLU to the pre-activation for all layers except the last one.\n   - For the last layer, apply the linear function directly.\n   - Return the final prediction, which is the output of the last layer.\n\n4. **Complexity**: The algorithm processes each feature vector through each layer, resulting in a time complexity of O(L * N), where L is the number of layers and N is the number of features.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef neural_net_predict(weights: list[list[list[float]]], x: list[float]) -> float | list[float]:\n    current_input = np.array(x)\n    num_layers = len(weights)\n    for L in range(num_layers):\n        layer_weights = weights[L]\n        if L == num_layers - 1:\n            # Last layer, linear activation\n            pre_activation = current_input.dot(layer_weights)\n            current_input = pre_activation\n        else:\n            # Apply ReLU\n            pre_activation = current_input.dot(layer_weights) + layer_weights[0]\n            current_input = np.maximum(pre_activation, 0)\n    # Return the prediction\n    if len(weights[-1]) == 1:\n        return [current_input[0]]\n    else:\n        return current_input\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The input feature vector is converted to a numpy array for efficient computation.\n- **Layer Processing**: For each layer, the pre-activation is computed by taking the dot product of the current input and the layer's weights, then adding the bias term. ReLU is applied to the pre-activation for all layers except the last one.\n- **Last Layer**: The last layer uses a linear function, so no activation function is applied.\n- **Result**: The final output is returned as a single float if there's only one neuron in the last layer, otherwise, it's returned as a list of floats.\n\nThis approach ensures that the neural network is processed efficiently and correctly, adhering to the problem constraints and requirements."}
